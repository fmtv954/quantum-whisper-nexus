· Must work with our actual tech stack (Next.js 14, Supabase, LiveKit, etc.)
· Must demonstrate core value proposition (lead capture, cost savings)
· Must include immediate verification of success

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

Reference: Tech stack specifications, API documentation, and platform architecture from previous documents.

TASK

Generate a 10-minute implementation guide with these phases:

1. Environment Setup (2 minutes)
2. First Campaign Creation (3 minutes)
3. Voice Flow Configuration (3 minutes)
4. Test & Verification (2 minutes)
5. Next Steps

VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT

User should complete a real voice call that captures contact information and creates a lead in the dashboard.

ROLLBACK INSTRUCTIONS

Each step includes "If this fails" alternatives and reset procedures.

COMMON ERRORS & FIXES

· Environment variable issues → Validation checklist
· Audio permissions → Browser configuration steps
· API rate limits → Fallback testing methods

NEXT STEP PREPARATION

After this guide, users will be ready for Document 2.1: System Architecture Deep Dive.

Quantum Voice AI - 10-Minute Quick Start Guide

🚀 Get Your First Voice AI Campaign Live in 10 Minutes

Prerequisites Checklist

· Node.js 18.x or higher
· Supabase account (free tier)
· Deepgram account (free credits)
· OpenAI API key

---

⏱️ Phase 1: Environment Setup (2 minutes)

1.1 Clone and Configure

```bash
# Clone the starter template
git clone github.com/quantum-voice/starter-template.git
cd quantum-voice-starter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local
```

1.2 Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# AI Services
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_secret

# Google Gemini (optional for Phase 1)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

Verification: Run npm run dev and check for "Environment variables loaded successfully"

---

⏱️ Phase 2: First Campaign Creation (3 minutes)

2.1 Database Setup

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO campaigns (
  name, 
  description, 
  status, 
  created_at
) VALUES (
  'First Test Campaign',
  'My initial voice AI campaign',
  'active',
  NOW()
) RETURNING id;
```

Save the returned campaign ID - you'll need it for the next steps.

2.2 Basic Campaign Configuration

```typescript
// In your campaign settings
const campaignConfig = {
  name: "First Test Campaign",
  voice: "aura-2", // Deepgram Aura voice
  speakingRate: 1.0,
  maxCallDuration: 360, // 6 minutes
  handoffTrigger: "time_or_complexity"
};
```

Verification: Campaign appears in /campaigns list with "Active" status.

---

⏱️ Phase 3: Voice Flow Configuration (3 minutes)

3.1 Simple Conversation Flow

Navigate to /flows/designer/[your-campaign-id]

Configure these 3 essential nodes:

Start Node:

```yaml
Greeting: "Hello! Thanks for calling. I'm here to help answer your questions and connect you with the right person."
Tone: Friendly and professional
Voice: aura-2
```

Lead Gate Node:

```yaml
Contact Capture:
  - "May I get your email address to follow up with more information?"
  - "What's the best phone number to reach you?"
Validation: Basic email format check
```

End Node:

```yaml
Closing: "Thanks for your time! Someone from our team will contact you shortly."
Next Steps: "Look for an email from us within the next 10 minutes."
```

3.2 Knowledge Base (Quick Setup)

```bash
# Upload a simple FAQ document
echo "Q: What are your business hours?
A: We're available 24/7 through this voice AI service.

Q: How quickly will someone contact me?
A: We promise a callback within 10 minutes for urgent inquiries.

Q: What services do you offer?
A: We provide [your services here]." > knowledge-base.txt
```

Upload via /knowledge/upload interface.

⏱️ Phase 4: Test & Verification (2 minutes)

4.1 Generate Test QR Code

Navigate to /campaigns/[id]/qr-codes

Generate QR code with default settings and scan with your phone.

4.2 Complete Test Call

1. Scan QR code with your phone
2. Enter test email: test@yourcompany.com
3. Wait for 2 rings and AI to answer
4. Have a 1-minute conversation:
   · "Hi, I'm interested in your services"
   · Provide test contact information
   · Ask a simple question from your knowledge base

4.3 Verify Success

Check three confirmation points:

Dashboard (/dashboard):

· Active call shows in real-time panel
· Lead appears in recent leads table

Leads Page (/leads):

· Test lead with contact information captured
· Conversation transcript available

Cost Monitoring (/dashboard/cost-monitoring):

· Call cost shows ~$0.03-0.05 (1-minute call)

---

✅ Success Checklist

· Environment configured without errors
· Campaign created and active
· Basic conversation flow configured
· QR code generated and scannable
· Test call completed successfully
· Lead captured in dashboard
· Cost under $0.05 for test call

---

🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

"Environment Variables Not Loading"

```bash
# Verify .env.local format
cat .env.local
# Should show key=value pairs without spaces around =
```

"QR Code Not Triggering Call"

· Check campaign status is "active"
· Verify LiveKit service is running
· Test with different QR scanner app

"No Audio in Call"

· Ensure browser microphone permissions granted
· Check Deepgram API key validity
· Test with headphones (sometimes speaker issues)

"Lead Not Appearing in Dashboard"

· Check Supabase connection
· Verify RLS policies aren't blocking inserts
· Check browser console for API errors
